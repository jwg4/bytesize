        If max_places is set to None, all non-zero digits after the
        decimal point will be shown.  Otherwise, max_places digits will
        be shown.

        If strip is True and there is a fractional quantity, trailing
        zeros are removed up to (and including) the decimal point.

        min_value sets the smallest value allowed.
        If min_value is 10, then single digits on the lhs of
        the decimal will be avoided if possible. In that case,
        9216 KiB is preferred to 9 MiB. However, 1 B has no alternative.
        If min_value is 1, however, 9 MiB is preferred.
        If min_value is 0.1, then 0.75 GiB is preferred to 768 MiB,
        but 0.05 GiB is still displayed as 51.2 MiB.

        The default for strip is False, so that precision is always shown
        to max_places.
